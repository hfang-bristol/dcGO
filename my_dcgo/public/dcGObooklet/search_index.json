The dcGO database addresses this need, enabling systematic annotations of domains using ontologies. 1.2 Timelines The idea/method of mapping Gene Ontology (GO) terms onto protein superfamily and family domains was first described in the SUPERFAMILY 2011 Nucleic Acids Research database issue paper. As a result of this generalised method applied to ontologies of diverse contexts, we generated a resource dcGO officially released in the dcGO 2013 Nucleic Acids Research database issue paper, developed the software (dcGOR), and supported the updates of the SUPERFAMILY database (see 2015 and 2019). 1.3 Contents Over time (10 years on), the dcGO resource has evolved to support annotations for protein domains of different levels, not only SCOP superfamilies and families, but also Pfam families and InterPro families. Such annotations are made available in a wide variety of knowledge contexts: functions (GO) pathways (see KEGG, REACTOME, PANTHER, WikiPathways and MitoCarta) transcriptional regulators (see ENRICHR Consensus TFs and TRRUST TFs) molecular hallmarks (see MSIGDB hallmarks) phenotypes in human and mouse, and other model organisms (including worm, fly, zebrafish and Arabidopsis) diseases (see Disease Ontology and EFO disease traits) drugs (see DGIdb druggable categories and Open Targets tractability buckets) 1.4 Mining In parallel with the growth in knowledgebase (both protein domains and biomedical ontologies), the dcGO now provides the users with new web interfaces and various mining opportunities, including: FACETED SEARCH, an entry point to mine the resource with keywords in query returning term-specific pages and domain-specific pages; ONTOLOGY HIERARCHY, browsing alongside annotated domains and crosslinked terms according to shared domain annotations; and ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS, identifying the knowledge of functions, phenotypes, diseases and many others that are enriched/over-represented within an input list of protein domains; see Example Output.

"],["faceted-search.html", "Section 4 Faceted Search", " Section 4 Faceted Search The faceted search is a mining hub, providing hyperlinks from the search results. In addition to identifiers, full text query is also supported for protein domains and ontology terms. Search results for domains are hyperlinked to domain-specific pages with the tabular display for ontology terms used to annotate them. Search results for a particular ontology terms are hyperlinked to the term-specific page, displaying the term information, annotated domains (of different levels), and where available, crosslinked terms (according to the degree of shared annotations for SCOP domains).
